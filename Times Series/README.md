# Times-Series-Projects


In this repositries,  i worked on  another exciting application of machine learning : the time series. 
There ' s two projects :

1- I worked on a type of data(Shampoo sales data)  that a trend and seasonality so i had the oppurtunity to use the ARMA,ARIMA, SARIMA models.

2- I worked on  financial data that is characterised by having an important volatility, So ARCH and GARCH is a good models for this case
